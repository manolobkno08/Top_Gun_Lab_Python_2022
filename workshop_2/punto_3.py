"""
Without resistance bodies fall at the same velocity regardless of their mass, shape and composition. When an object is dropped, the distance it travels is proportional to the time d = v∗t ± (12)∗g∗𝑡2, where

- d is the distance traveled.
- g is the acceleration originated by gravity, i.e., 9.8𝑚𝑠2.
- t is the elapsed time.

In honor of the great scientist Galilei, it would be necessary to implement an application that, given the height in meters of a building from which a sphere is to be launched, would show the distance traveled second by second until it hits the ground.
